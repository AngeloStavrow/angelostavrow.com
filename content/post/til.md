I set up a [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) for myself — prompted by watching [this talk by Sönke Ahrens](https://vimeo.com/275530205) yesterday. I'm very much intrigued by the idea of [digital gardens](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880) or the idea of a public [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de), but I'm neither experienced with this style of note-taking nor quite certain what all I should capture there.

<!-- Copy and Paste Me -->
<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/angelo-til?path=README.md&previewSize=100"
    title="angelo-til on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

Maybe the best plan is to have no plan: for now, I'll treat it as a "Today I Learned" (or "TIL") catch-all for notes, apply tags indiscriminately, and see what comes together. I don't know if TiddlyWiki is the right tool for the job, but everything I've read so far is compelling.

More TK.
