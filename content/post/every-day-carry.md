!["Rhodia A7 notebook with Fisher Bullet space pen"](/images/2018-09-02/rhodia.jpeg)

Since mid-February, a notebook has become a big part of my productivity system. There's something about putting pen to paper that's inherently more satisfying to me than poking at keys to make characters appear on a screen. Over six months later, I'm still writing in it daily.

I don't carry my notebook with me everywhere, though. I carry very little with me, in fact: my phone, wallet, and my keys (and really, only the keys that I need). There's something about the encumbrance of carrying a lot of stuff that irritates me.

On Friday, however, I picked up a [Rhodia A7 notebook][a7] for a couple of bucks. It's quite small and, paired with a [Fisher Bullet space pen][pen], adds very little bulk to my pockets. The first thing I did was completely deface the first page with random lines and scrawl a note to myself on a moving train:

> There â€” now you can use this notebook.
> 
> Enjoy.

I've carried it with me for only one full day and I've already filled a couple of pages with some notes based on a phrase I heard.

Now, I could have just as easily captured that phrase in my phone. I'm not sure that the rest of my thoughts on the idea, however, would have flowed as easily. I find that there's something inherently more frictionless with putting ideas into a scrappy little book; it's a very free-form medium, devoid of any requirements for line spacing or margins.

I don't know if transcribing notes to my main notebook will get annoying. Or if that's even necessary, really. And despite the small size, it _is_ one more physical thing (well, two, if you count the pen) that I have to carry around, and I do notice it.

I'm not sure if this new habit will take, but so far it's off to a good start.
