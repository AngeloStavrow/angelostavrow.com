It's been almost four months since I last wrote something. I've been pretty busy over the last little while completely overhauling this site, and there are a few changes that I'd like to point out.

<!--more-->

From here on out, this will be the home of my personal blog. All article from [Make Before Break][mbb] have been imported here; any new long-form writing will be posted to this site, and here only.

Short updates will continue to be posted to my [microblog][mb], which is syndicated to [my Twitter account][twitter]. I generally reply to anyone who `@`-mentions me on either service, but I tend to spend more time in my RSS reader than my Twitter timeline.

This site runs a custom-built [Hugo][hugo] theme I built. I based this theme on some [beliefs][philosophy] about what a website should be like in 2018. The work here isn't quite done yet, so please let me know if you see anything amiss. You can find out more about this on [the about page][about].

That's it for now!
