[Last week I wrote][last-week] about defining my goals a bit more carefully, making sure that projects I undertake fit _who I want to be_ and _how I feel_, set in the context of _what I’m capable of_. Part of that meant making some hard decisions about which projects I'll put in my backlog, and which projects I'll drop altogether. The work I'd started on a [Manuscript integration][mu-integration] is one of the latter.

Working on [Indigo] reminded me that taking on a project is more than just hitting ⌘+N, writing the code, and putting it out into the world; in fact, the development part of the project lifecycle might not even be the bulk of of the work. The bigger chunk of the work comes from maintaining it indefinetly; do you want to continue improving that project for the rest of your life?

(No, I probably won't work on any given project for the rest of my life, but I still think it's worth framing it that way, because it forces me to place a very high value on my time.)

Indigo is something that I'll continue working on, as it powers my personal site. [Per] is something that I use often, so I'll continue maintaining it (despite my lack of frequency in updating the app).

The reality is, however, that I probably won't get much use out of a Manuscript integration that pulls in reviews from the App Store, because there's just no volume there for my own apps. That means if and when it breaks, I won't notice until users start having a bad experience. That's… _not great_.

So, the project is being archived. If you're a Manuscript user and you're interested in the idea, let me know and I'm happy to walk you through what I've got so far.

More tk.
