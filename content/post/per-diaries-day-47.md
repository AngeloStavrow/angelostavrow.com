> This post is part of a series about rewriting my iOS app, [Per](https://droppedbits.com/apps/per). Per is a price per unit comparison app with a bunch of neat convenience figures, but it hasn't been updated in years, so I'm rewriting it from scratch to eliminate a bunch of technical debt. Just because it's not an open-source app doesn't mean I can't share what I learn as I go!

## Take Care Of Yourself

I'm taking a break from this work today because it feels like everything is falling apart right now and I need some time to sort out my own needs. That's way more important than _not breaking the streak_.
