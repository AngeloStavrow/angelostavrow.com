title: "Yes, I'm Changing My Blog Too"
date: 2021-01-02T09:17:59-05:00
draft: true
summary: I haven't posted anything to the blog living at angelostavrow.com in about two and a half months. That doesn't mean I haven't been writing.

Like many folks who keep a blog, I like to fiddle with setups and reorganize my "online presence" every so often. But I've come to realize that the problem with _fiddling_ is that it's a distraction from _doing_. And if I want to do more (of whatever), then I've got to not only reduce the fiddling, but the friction as well.

[Hugo][1] is an excellent static site generator, and I've had a lot of fun building the [Indigo theme][2] that powers this site (as well as a few others!) — but it's time to retire it. If I want to write more (and I do!), being tied to a desktop and having to run incantations on the terminal to create a draft and publish the final article is… well, it's a pain. Yes, I can keep my drafts in [Drafts][3] or any other cross-platform writing app, but the fact remains that I still have to get to my Mac to publish. And if that Mac has to go in for servicing, then I need to find another machine, deploy all the fiddle bits that generate and publish the site, and hope that I remembered to commit any changes I'd made, either to the theme or the content.

It's a headache.

The way things are set up, I also need to switch contexts if I choose to publish a short, title-less "update" — for a few years now, long-form posts have been published to angelostavrow.com, and short posts have been published to [Micro.blog][4], with some additional plumbing set up to get each feed into the other site, as well as everything pushed out to various communities that I like to engage in.

Fact is, nothing takes the fun out of creating a thing more than having to maintain it.

So, in the interest of offloading the work that I'd taken upon myself, let's discuss how things will be changing.

Since [late November][5], I've been writing everything —that is, both long-form articles and short updates— on [angelostavrow.blog][6], which is a [Write.as][7]-hosted blog. This will be the new home for my writing; the [RSS feed][8] is pushed to my [Micro.blog account][9], where the cross-posting bot syndicates that content out to my [Twitter][10] and [Mastodon][11] accounts. I really like the focus Write.as puts on writing, but I like the communities with which I share my writing too, and this works really well to combine frictionless _writing_ with frictionless _sharing_.

(Disclaimer: I've been working with their team building the [official iOS app][12] for [WriteFreely][13], the open-source software that powers the Write.as service.)

I'm going to slowly import all posts on the old blog _and_ Micro.blog to this new blog, and I'm going to try to make sure that old permalinks continue to work. Then, I'll be free to do a bit of re-working of my online presence:

- My [dot-com][14] site will become a landing page of sorts, hosting some info about me and links to the various social networks I like to participate in.
- My [dot-dev][15] site is already a landing page for software-development-related links, but I'm going to take some time to improve it a little bit.
- I'm not decided yet whether I'll simply archive the Indigo theme, or see if someone else wants to take it over. I don't need to make this decision now, but I will share this in the [GitHub repo][16].

So there you go. Happy New Year, friends, and if you'd like, consider updating your feed readers to [the new blog's RSS feed][8].
