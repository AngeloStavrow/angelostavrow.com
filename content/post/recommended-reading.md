I spend a lot of time reading, and I've been thinking about periodically writing up a list of articles that I've recently enjoyed.

While I'm big on RSS ([Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) is my RSS service of choice), I do [also use it to subscribe to a few weekly newsletters](https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsletters-in-feedbin/) â€” here are my current favourites.

### [Jocelyn K. Glei &rarr;](https://jkglei.com)

Host of the [Hurry Slowly podcast](https://hurryslowly.co), this newsletter collects articles on finding time for creativity and meaningful work. I love both the podcast and newsletter so much that signing up for [the Reset Course](https://reset-course.com) was a no-brainer for me.

### [Dense Discovery &rarr;](https://www.densediscovery.com/)

Published by Kai Brach, this newsletter collects articles "at the intersection of tech, design, and culture." There's always a lot of great stuff here, including articles to read, tools to try, or designs to inspire.

### [Rad Reads &rarr;](https://radreads.co/)

Khe Hy writes about living (and working) deliberately ("with intention"), and curates a newletter that aims to help you be more creative, empathetic, and resilient.

### [Flashing Palely in the Margins &rarr;](https://buttondown.email/vasta)

[Sameer Vasta](https://www.inthemargins.ca/)'s newsletter is one of my newest discoveries, but it's rapidly become one of my favourites. A wonderful collection of interesting reads, thoughtful commentary, and a little poetry, this gem always makes me sit back and think.

More, as always, tk.
