> This post is part of a series about rewriting my iOS app, [Per]. Per is a price per unit comparison app with a bunch of neat convenience figures, but it hasn't been updated in years, so I'm rewriting it from scratch to eliminate a bunch of technical debt. Just because it's not an open-source app doesn't mean I can't share what I learn as I go!

## Funny subtitle goes here

On [day 2] of the rewrite, I put together a computed property for `pricePerUnit` in an extension to the `Product` protocol that looked like this:

```
var pricePerUnit: Double {
    get {
        let formatter = NumberFormatter()
        formatter.numberStyle = .currency
        let formattedPricePerUnit = formatter.string(for: NSNumber(value: price / quantity))
        return Double(truncating: formatter.number(from: formattedPricePerUnit!)!)
    }
}
```

As I mentioned at the time, I still don't like the way I'm doing the necessary work  of rounding digits using the `NumberFormatter` conversion to a `String` and back, but it works as a spike solution _for now_ â€” we can come back to it another day.

I also added two static functions to the extension [yesterday] so that the protocol better conforms to `Comparable` â€”Â not only do we want to compare the `pricePerUnit` property, but we also want to compare the types of `Unit`s and make sure they're comparable.

Here's where I need to be careful. I can use `quantity` and `units` properties to initialize a [`Measurement`], which gives me the ability to convert this to base units via the appropriately-named `baseUnits()` method on `Measurement` â€”Â this gives me a common unit to compare all items of the same unit type (`UnitMass` and `UnitVolume` are the two we care about). I can add the following logic to the `pricePerUnit` computed property getter and we're good to go:

```
var pricePerUnit: Double {
    get {
        var amount: Double = 0
        let formatter = NumberFormatter()
        formatter.numberStyle = .currency
        
        if let unitType = units {
            if (unitType.isKind(of: UnitMass.self)) {
                // This product is sold by weight.
                let measurement = Measurement(value: quantity, unit: unitType as! UnitMass).converted(to: UnitMass.baseUnit())
                amount = measurement.value
            } else if (unitType.isKind(of: UnitVolume.self)) {
                // This product is sold by volumne.
                let measurement = Measurement(value: quantity, unit: unitType as! UnitVolume).converted(to: UnitVolume.baseUnit())
                amount = measurement.value
            }
        } else {
            amount = quantity
        }
        // We're force-unwrapping here but these variables should never be nil. ðŸ˜¬
        return Double(truncating: formatter.number(from: formatter.string(for: NSNumber(value: price / amount))!)!)
    }
}
```

With that, we can set up a simple ProductList model and get it hooked up as a `UITableViewController` data source tomorrow!
