I've been thinking about adding a second kind of post to this site every week: a selection links that I found to be an interesting read during the week.

More specifically, I'm thinking about maybe three to five links, with a few words of my own commentary. Those links might be to freshly-published items, or they may be an interesting article from an archive somewhere. I don't really know.

What I do know, is that I come across a *lot* of thought-provoking, inspiring, or fascinating pieces of writing, and I want a more permanent place to share them than the Twitter firehose, or the Facebook walled garden.

To that end, I'll be moving my own writing to a Monday post, and a link post on Fridays.

More to comeâ€¦
