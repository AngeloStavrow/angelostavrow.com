> This post is part of a series about rewriting my iOS app, [Per](https://droppedbits.com/apps/per). Per is a price per unit comparison app with a bunch of neat convenience figures, but it hasn't been updated in years, so I'm rewriting it from scratch to eliminate a bunch of technical debt. Just because it's not an open-source app doesn't mean I can't share what I learn as I go!

## It's Okay To Take A Break

Nothing to report here today. I'm exhausted after a rough night and when my alarm went off at 5AM, I chose "roll over and go back to sleep" over "get up and hustle" because really, I don't hustle so good when I'm exhausted.

Build cool things. Create learning opportunities. And make sure to listen to your body, too.
