> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."

I'm not sure to whom the above quote is attributed, but I don't buy it.

The only way to do great work is to put in 100% of your attention and your effort, follow a thorough PDCA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> methodology, and understand that the quality of your work depends entirely on your will.

I get that this quote is supposed to be an inspirational call to action, but thinking that you can only excel at things that you love is equal parts reductive and defeatist.

I'll concede that it's easier to mail it in when you don't especially care for the work you're doing, but that doesn't mean you're forced to be mediocre about it.

Don't make excuses. Make great things—regardless of your passion for them.
