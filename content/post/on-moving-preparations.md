A short break from the usual posts for a bit of site news: by the end of February, I'm hoping to have completed the move of this site over to a static-site generator called [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

There are a few reasons for this.

First, I'm ready to leave Squarespace. It's not that there's anything really *wrong* with their service. It's pretty reliable, their customer service is great, and it's generally pretty easy to use. It's just that it's overkill for what I need (a simple blog), and while they're constantly bringing out new features, those features aren't really of interest to me&mdash;the features I *would* be interested in paying for just don't seem to be rolling out.

Second, while some basic customization is available to base-plan users, it just can't compare to the level of customization available to a roll-your-own, hackable, static-site generator.

Third, Hugo will be the basis for another project I'm slowly putting together, so this will be good practice.

While I will probably be re-architecting the way URLs are set up, Hugo has an [awesome built-in feature for handling redirects](http://gohugo.io/extras/aliases/), so all the old links should continue working. Comment will probably go away, which is fine, because there really aren't many. Going back to [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) is an option, but I'm really interested in [Civil Comments](https://www.civilcomments.com) too.

I'll follow up when the move is complete.
