> This post is part of a series about rewriting my iOS app, [Per](https://droppedbits.com/apps/per). Per is a price per unit comparison app with a bunch of neat convenience figures, but it hasn't been updated in years, so I'm rewriting it from scratch to eliminate a bunch of technical debt. Just because it's not an open-source app doesn't mean I can't share what I learn as I go!

## Onwards and Upwards

Just a short update today: as planned, I added the input accessory view to the detail form today. This only adds a simple previous/next toolbar button to skip between text fields in the form. It was nice to use SF Symbols for the left and right carets!

That gets us to feature parity — but now we've got the papercuts to deal with, with the hope that I'll have this installed on my phone for testing by the end of the week.

Tomorrow I take care of planning what to tackle first!
