Today marks the second anniversary of my gig at [Glitch](https://glitch.com) (formerly Fog Creek Software). Last year, [I wrote a retrospective](/post/remote-work-year-one/) on what the first year of working remotely was like; I thought it’d be fun to see how that’s evolved.

## What’s scary about working remotely?

Last year, I said that there wasn’t very much that I found to be scary about working remotely. That’s still true! I do still find that I can go days without leaving the house for social interaction or physical activity, but I have been better about that too. I tend to work on personal projects from coffee shops every so often; this year, I’ve been toying with the idea of using a co-working space once in a while to get away from my home office, too. That will probably only happen once the weather improves.

## What’s good about working remotely?

Last year, I talked about the ability to focus and the commute (or lack thereof). That’s still very true, and now that I’m in a more flexible role, I am (as I mentioned above) kind of liking the idea of working from wherever, whenever. I’ve been identifying peak hours for my own productivity, and while I still need to have a pretty good 9-to-5 overlap, it’s really nice to be able to step away to handle personal affairs and catch up later in the day.

## Let’s talk about career development.

I still haven’t taken advantage of things like conference budgets, so that’s not great. There’s been a lot of change at Glitch over the last few months, so things like the mentorship program have been put on hold for a bit. I miss that, but I’ve been doing a lot of courses (mostly from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses)) to level-up my web development game.

### How do you learn from your colleagues remotely?

We’ve got `#learning` and `#codereview` channels in Slack for posting things you’re learning and requesting feedback on your code, respectively, and these are pretty great; we also have a standing daily hour-long video hangout where you can jump in to work on projects with others. It sometimes happens that I’m in there alone, though.

## How do you stay plugged into spontaneous conversations around the office?

Slack. To quote Anne Helen Petersen’s comment the [_Hurry Slowly_ podcast](https://hurryslowly.co/anne-helen/), it’s like LARPing your workday. There’s also a policy of posting notes whenever two or more people have a meeting; these are available for anyone in the company to read, so if there’s a spontaneous conversation of some consequence to the product or business, you can learn more.

### How do you have idle/watercooler discussions?

There’s no change in this from last year, though we didn’t continue with [Donut](https://donut.ai) after all; it was great for pairing a small group of people, but it was hard to get one person to take charge and schedule something.

## What happens if you spend a week stuck on a problem?

Things are a little different with my new gig as a solutions engineer as there isn’t exactly somewhere to escalate, but talking about your blockers in a 1:1 or in weekly team check-ins usually gets things moving in the right direction. These days, “getting stuck” can go one of two ways: being stuck technically (not being sure how to implement a feature or solve a bug), or being stuck in a conversation (not being sure how to answer a partner’s question, for example).

And of course, there’s always the `#ask` channel (or team-specific channels) in Slack to ask questions. That’s really the most important thing: instead of getting frustrated by spinning your wheels when trying to solve a problem, ask questions and seek advice. It helps that I get to work with phenomenally talented people, too.

## What’s the setup like for meetings with people in the office, and does it work well?

There’s no change here over last year. I really like that even with a good chunk of the Glitch team working at HQ in NYC, meetings are still conducted with each person at their computer. It’s never a conference room full of people and a couple of lonely remote folks, which is great.

## How do you stay productive and also separate work/life at home?

Staying productive hasn’t changed, though I tend to spend more time thinking in my day job than I used to. I also tend to spend a bit more time in my home office these days, to either [work on the podcast](https://www.makebeforebreak.com) or [practice guitar](/post/fretting/), but I still try to define pretty rigid start and end times to my day. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t pop into Slack every so often outside of my normal working hours, but usually that’s to check out what’s happening in `#food`, `#pets`, `#fitness`, or `#offtopic`. If I have an idea for work, I tend to dump it into OmniFocus for consideration at the start of the next workday. You can’t help when you’ll have an idea, but you _can_ protect the time you’ve defined for your life outside of work.
