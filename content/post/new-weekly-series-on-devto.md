I kicked off a new weekly "development diary" series on Dev.to today.

> This post is an entry in a weekly development diary on building a feed-aggregator-based blog on [Glitch]. Only a small part of building an app is code; the bulk of your time is spent planning, experimenting, making mistakes, getting frustrated, and making progress in baby steps.

You can [read the first post here]. The goal is to build a web app that takes as input an [OPML file] of your RSS feeds across various platforms, and automagically generates a blog with its own "firehose" RSS feed with that content.

I really found it helpful when I journaled daily while [rewriting my iOS app]. I hope you find it interesting too.
