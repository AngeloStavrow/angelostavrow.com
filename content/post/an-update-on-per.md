Just because I closed out the [Per rewrite journal] in late March, doesn't mean I'm not still working on the [app]! Here's what's been happening.

## Minimum Dogfoodable Product â€”Â 2020-04-30

At the end of April, I closed out last issue in the _Minimum Dogfoodable Product_ (MDP) milestone. This represents the first internal release that gets the rewritten app to feature parity with v1.2, the currently-shipping version [in the App Store]. At that point, Christina and I replaced the shipping version of the app on our iPhones to start, as the milestone name implies, dogfooding it.

## Minimum Launchable Product â€”Â 2020-07-06

With that done, I moved on to issues in the _Minimum Launchable Product_ (MLP) milestone. This release represents an internal beta that collects bugfixes from using the MDP along with a set of launch-blocking features to be implemented before releasing the first external beta. That work wrapped up yesterday, so now we're on to the _Minimum Viable Product_ (MVP)!

## Minimum Viable Product â€” TBA

The MVP, once work is complete, will be the first externally-available (via [Testflight]) release of the app, and includes all features planned for the public release. The plumbing and framing was completed in the MLP work, so now â€”new bugs notwithstandingâ€” it's about UI and UX polish. I've been building Per with mostly-stock UIKit components and typography, such that I get things like accessibility and dark-mode support (mostly) for free. But as Christina's pointed out, there's lots of little UX improvements that can be made, and a little bit of UI/personality would be nice, too.

## So, New Features?

You've already seen [one] of the new features: increasing the number of compared products beyond two.

New features will, for the most part, live behind a small in-app purchase. Because the current version is free, I don't want anyone to lose out on existing functionality; free users will get to compare up to three products, with paying customers being able to compare unlimited products (or some technologically-constrained number that approximates "unlimited").

The in-app purchase will also unlock something I've _personally_ been wishing for: a way to save a product for later. Like many, I know where to go to get the best price on certain staples, but I don't always remember exactly what that price or quantity is. So, when I come across some sale on that product at another store, I can't be sure if it's a better deal or not. ðŸ¤”

Well, with the next release of Per, you'll be able to save that information for later. It's been a fun feature to implement, including setting up persistence with SQLite/[FMDB], but it still needs some more work to get it where I'd like. I hope you'll find it useful!

Will there be other features? Yes, eventually, but probably not for this release. So, as always, more TK.
