## About Me

I'm a software generalist with over a decade of experience writing code. My training in financial accounting means I understand business/organization requirements; my training in electrical engineering and quality-management auditing has developed strong troubleshooting and debugging skills. I believe in accessibility, performance, and inclusivity, and I'm available for short-term, long-term, and rolling (annual) contract work.
