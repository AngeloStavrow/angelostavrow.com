This is my personal website and blog. If you'd like to know more about what I'm up to at the moment, check out my [now](/now) page. You can get in touch with me via [email](mailto:contact@angelostavrow.com).

## Philosophy
This site includes a `philosphy.txt`. [Check it out](../philosophy.txt).

## What you’ll find here
I enjoy writing, which is good, because I’m terrible at it and they say that the only way to improve is through practice. From here on out, this is where my writing will live. I write about pretty much whatever topic comes to mind, but it's typically focused on development, of both the personal and software persuasion.

## Privacy policy
I don't use any analytics on this site. I tried anayltics on a personal site and frankly, the data and trends weren't interesting to me. If you like what you read, I hope you'll come back. If not, I'll try to do better.

If you email me, I'll read your email! By extension, that means I will have a record of your email address.  I won't use it for anything other than replying to you without your explicit, written consent.

### Affiliate links
I used to use affiliate links to generate revenue. They… didn't. I don't use affiliate links any more. I've tried to go back and remove them from old posts, but if I've missed any, please [let me know](mailto:contact@angelostavrow.com).

## The stack
This site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and runs a custom theme I built called _indigo_. It’s still a work in progress, so please let me know if anything seems amiss. I apologize in advance.

### Typography

This site makes use of the following wonderful typefaces:

- [Fira Sans](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FiraSans/#!layout=specimen) for heading text
- [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) for body text
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for monospaced text

Licenses are included in the indigo theme's `static/fonts` folder.
