This is my personal website and blog. If you'd like to know more about what I'm up to at the moment, check out my [now](/now) page, or have a look at my [microblog](https://angelo.micro.blog). You can get in touch with me via [email](mailto:contact@angelostavrow.com), and if you'd like to work with me, check out [this page](/work-with-me).

## Philosophy

This site includes a `philosphy.txt`. [Check it out](../philosophy.txt).

## What you’ll find here

I enjoy writing, which is good, because I’m terrible at it and they say that the only way to improve is through practice. From here on out, this is where my writing will live. I write about pretty much whatever topic comes to mind, but it's typically focused on development, of both the personal and software persuasion.

## Where you'll find more of my stuff

There's a row of social-network icons at the bottom of this site, linking to my various profiles.

## Privacy policy

I don't use any analytics on this site. I tried anayltics on a personal site and frankly, the data and trends weren't interesting to me. If you like what you read, I hope you'll come back. If not, I'll try to do better.

If you email me, I'll read your email! By extension, that means I will have a record of your email address.  I won't use it for anything other than replying to you without your explicit, written consent.

### Affiliate links

I used to use affiliate links to generate revenue. They… didn't. I don't use affiliate links any more. I've tried to go back and remove them from old posts, but if I've missed any, please [let me know](mailto:contact@angelostavrow.com).

## The stack

This site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and runs a custom fork of a theme I built called [_Indigo_](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo). Indigo includes a few IndieWeb features that you can read about [here](/post/introducing-indigo/).

### Typography

This site makes use of the following wonderful typefaces:

- [Fira Sans](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FiraSans/#!layout=specimen) for heading text
- [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) for body text
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for monospaced text

Licenses are included in the Indigo theme's [`static/fonts` folder](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/tree/master/static/fonts).
