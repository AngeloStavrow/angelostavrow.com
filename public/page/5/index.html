        I&rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about people and some popular techniques that they use to try to improve the quality of their lives.
Specifically, I wonder if successful application of GTD, YNAB&rsquo;s rules, or KonMari&mdash;essentially, the curation of stuff (life, money, possessions)&mdash;might be self-selecting.
Curation is maybe a bit of a weak description. These are methodologies for the processing of inputs with the goal of (typically measurable) progress towards a desired state.

        I rarely get sick, and when I do, it seldom lasts more than 72 hours. Having just recently gotten over a nasty cold, however, I have a couple of thoughts on the matter of working through cold and flu season.
Inevitably, there will always be someone who feels that they can&rsquo;t, for whatever reason, afford to take a sick day. So they load up on decongestants, fight their way in to the office, where they basically fill a seat with their butt, a trashcan with their snotty tissues, and their workplace with their germs.

        The January 28th episode of Under The Radar, Apps With Personality, left me thinking about just why software from bigger software publishers tend to be more… well, bland.
A lot of it surely comes down to the design-by-committee (or, in the worst case, design-by-accountants/lawyers) way of working that David and Marco alluded to, but I think there&rsquo;s something else worth considering.
Every business-school student has heard the (actually false) Chevy Nova &ldquo;legend&rdquo;, whereby GM execs scratched their heads in trying to figure out why sales of the car were so poor in Latin America.

        I&rsquo;ve been thinking about adding a second kind of post to this site every week: a selection links that I found to be an interesting read during the week.
More specifically, I&rsquo;m thinking about maybe three to five links, with a few words of my own commentary. Those links might be to freshly-published items, or they may be an interesting article from an archive somewhere. I don&rsquo;t really know.
What I do know, is that I come across a lot of thought-provoking, inspiring, or fascinating pieces of writing, and I want a more permanent place to share them than the Twitter firehose, or the Facebook walled garden.

        I&#39;ve been allowing myself to get too distracted by random projects. It&#39;s time to cull that list and redouble my efforts on the key projects.
&mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) January 23, 2016 
Years ago, as part of an engineering internship prep course, I had to do a Myers-Briggs personality test. The results indicated that I&rsquo;m an ENFP type.
While the MBTI was proven to be mostly malarky, one thing that keeps coming up about ENFP types is that they have trouble with follow-through.

        A short break from the usual posts for a bit of site news: by the end of February, I&rsquo;m hoping to have completed the move of this site over to a static-site generator called Hugo.
There are a few reasons for this.
First, I&rsquo;m ready to leave Squarespace. It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s anything really wrong with their service. It&rsquo;s pretty reliable, their customer service is great, and it&rsquo;s generally pretty easy to use.

        Two weeks ago, I wrote that I wanted to write more&mdash;primarily by posting to the blog once a week, and by writing in a journal daily.
So far, the journal has been a success. I haven&rsquo;t missed a day, because it&rsquo;s easy: I launch Day One on a device, and just write. I don&rsquo;t limit myself to certain topics, I don&rsquo;t use any tags, I don&rsquo;t add photos, and I certainly don&rsquo;t worry about length.

        We&rsquo;re now a week in to the new year. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I&rsquo;m not really one for resolutions, but here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been on my mind lately. A proposal, of sorts, in two parts.
 Be the person that makes you happy. Be the person that makes other people happy.  Here&rsquo;s the how and why of it, as I see it.
   Part&nbsp;1 Part&nbsp;2 Situation     ❌ ❌ This is the worst-case scenario.

        A lot of people seem to think that New Year&rsquo;s resolutions are a waste of time. While I agree that any day is a good day to make changes, I also know that I like things in neat and tidy little parcels, and a year is a very nice little short- to medium-term period of time for setting goals, and revisiting them to see how you did.
I didn&rsquo;t try anything like that for 2015.

        I&rsquo;m a firm believer in automation.
Computers are great environments for this—scripting languages (and convenient utilities that leverage them, like Hazel, TextExpander, or If This Then That) make it trivial to organize, queue, and execute all kinds of tasks that otherwise time away from more enjoyable things.
• • •
Life can be a bit harder to automate. It can get expensive, too, because automating real-life tasks tends to require both hardware and software, working in concert, to manipulate the physical world.
