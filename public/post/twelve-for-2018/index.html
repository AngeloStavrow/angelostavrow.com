        <p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m a bit late to the party, but: rather than try to create a bunch of resolutions, I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôd prefer to take on twelve projects this year. Why twelve? Well, largely because it breaks down to one project per month (not that I intend these to be month-long projects, it just works out that way).</p>

<p>In no particular order of importance, they are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Learn a new language:</strong> My wife and I have been talking about doing this together. We don&rsquo;t expect to develop fluency in a language by year end, but at the very least some conversational level where, if we were in some country, we&rsquo;d be able to chat with local folks in their own language. Right now, we&rsquo;re trying to decide on the language.</li>
<li><strong>Ship Per 2.0:</strong> The last update to Per was in September of 2015. The app generally works fine, and we use it all the time when out shopping for groceries, but I have ideas for features (and am aware that the UI could <em>really</em> use an overhaul).</li>
<li><strong>Run five kilometres:</strong> In a row. In one session. I&rsquo;ve never been an active person, and that&rsquo;s going to bite me in my later years. So I&rsquo;m going to tackle a couch-to-5k program and aim to be able to run a solid 5km by year end.</li>
<li><strong>Read one book a month:</strong> I really stink at getting through my reading list. I aim to read one book a month to try to ramp that back up (and take advantage of the cool <a href="http://www.manton.org/2018/01/books-on-micro-blog.html"><em>Books on Micro.blog</em> collection</a> implementation to discuss them). <a href="https://micro.blog/discover/books">üìö</a></li>
<li><strong>Build one Manuscript integration:</strong> Basing myself on <a href="https://medium.com/make-better-software/how-to-get-started-making-manuscript-integrations-6da236b68f98">this article</a>, I&rsquo;m going to build a (relatively simple) <a href="https://manuscript.com">Manuscript</a> integration that pulls App Store reviews into Manuscript.</li>
<li><strong>Build a micro.blog sample app in Glitch:</strong> I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of value in micro.blog, but right now the barrier to entry (compared to signing up for a free Twitter account) is high enough that it won&rsquo;t appeal beyond the folks who already blog (or who are able to pay US$5 per month for a hosted microblog) ‚Äî¬†a diminishingly small portion of the potential member base. Creating a free, remixable sample app in <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> might help with accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Pay off my credit card debt:</strong> I used to be really bad with my spending. I&rsquo;m significantly better now, but I&rsquo;ve got some lingering credit-card debt that really needs to go.</li>
<li><strong>De-clutter my belongings:</strong> I have a lot of stuff. A good chunk of that stuff is stuff that I don&rsquo;t need and never use. It&rsquo;s time to let go of a lot of that.</li>
<li><strong>Write more often:</strong> I mean, I can&rsquo;t really do much worse than my one-post-per-year low from last year. Technically, this is my second post for 2018, so I&rsquo;m already winning this one. I aim to write about my progress on this list of projects over the course of the year, so at least I already have some topics lined up.</li>
<li><strong>Rework my personal website and blogs:</strong> My stuff is scattered across this blog, the (new) <a href="https://angelo.micro.blog">microblog</a>, my mostly-ignored <a href="http://breakbeforemake.com">Tumblr</a>, and my personal site. Time to think about how to bring all that together.</li>
<li><strong>Back-squat 225 lbs:</strong> Similar to the 5K goal, I aim to focus on some strength training at the gym. I&rsquo;d started on a <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">5&times;5 lifting program</a> last year and, despite some fits and starts, went from squatting just the bar to 155lbs in six months ‚Äî¬†a 240% improvement. Those are the easy percents, though, and I&rsquo;m hoping to be able to get up to two plates by the end of the year, despite starting from (nearly) scratch after a 6-month hiatus.</li>
<li><strong>Start playing piano again:</strong> I haven&rsquo;t seriously played piano in over 20 years. I&rsquo;ve set up a keyboard in my home office to inspire me to do that again, but I&rsquo;ve yet to actually start tickling the ivories, as they say. But, I mean, I did make this <a href="https://noiseless-airmail.glitch.me">web-audio synthesizer in Glitch</a> to learn some JavaScript, so that kinda counts. Right?</li>
</ol>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s to 2018. I hope you make great progress on your projects and goals this year, too.</p>
