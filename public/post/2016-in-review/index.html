<p>At the beginning of the year, I <a href="/post/on-fresh-starts/">wrote down some goals</a> for 2016. The year has come and gone, so it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to have a bit of a look at how things went.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<h3 id="1-post-something-here-every-friday">1. Post something here every Friday</h3>

<p>I did pretty well at this for a while, up until late August. But as the year wore on it felt more and more that I was writing just for the sake of checking off a repeating to-do item, rather than writing a goal in and of itself.</p>

<p>Not only did I feel that in the quality of what I was writing, I think this started injecting stress into my life. That, of course, is bad.</p>

<p>I also found that trying to get some words up on screen every week took time away from working on some of the projects (writing or otherwise) that I really wanted to work on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to continue with a less-frequent schedule, putting up a minimum of one article a month. I&rsquo;m also going to try posting to <a href="http://breakbeforemake.com">Break Before Make</a> more often&mdash;it&rsquo;s been sorely neglected.</p>

<h3 id="2-post-to-a-journal-at-least-once-every-day">2. Post to a journal at least once every day</h3>

<p>I discussed this <a href="/post/a-six-month-update/">six months ago</a>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try a written journal, just because I like working on my penmanship, but honestly, it felt like something taken on because someone said it was a good idea, rather than because I found that it worked for me.</p>

<h3 id="3-make-real-progress-towards-my-mac-app">3. Make real progress towards my Mac app</h3>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I founded a company five years ago with the intention of releasing this.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve made no real inroads in the actual <em>coding</em>, I have made a pretty important decision regarding the focus of the app. I think this pivot will help more people, so I&rsquo;ve fleshed out a bit of a roadmap for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m making 2017 the year it finally sees the light of day.</p>

<h3 id="4-contribute-to-open-source-projects">4. Contribute to open-source projects</h3>

<p>Not much here. I did <a href="https://github.com/sxg/ForecastIO/pull/24">help update a library for Swift 3</a> but that wasn&rsquo;t really much of a contribution, I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;it was mainly more of a &ldquo;fix what the Xcode migration assistant broke&rdquo; kind of fix.</p>

<p>I also <a href="/tags/tghr/">open-sourced my first iOS app</a>, but haven&rsquo;t really done much with that, either. It&rsquo;s still more-or-less in burning-dumpster-fire state, which is to say, it <em>really</em> looks like a first iOS app.</p>

<h3 id="5-get-in-better-shape">5. Get in better shape</h3>

<p>I did pretty well at running at least a couple of times a week between end of March and mid-October. Once the snow&mdash;or worse, freezing rain&mdash;started coming down, however, that trend kind of tapered off.</p>

<p>I miss it, so I&rsquo;ve registered at a gym with an indoor track and a pool.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="onwards-and-upwards">Onwards and upwards</h2>

<p>Any day is a good day to make changes, because we live <a href="/post/flux/">in a state of flux</a>. So, despite missing marks and/or changing course over the last year, I&rsquo;m still going to set some goals for the next year:</p>

<h3 id="goal-health">Goal: <em>Health</em></h3>

<p>As I said, I&rsquo;m registering at a gym down the street from where I live, where I can do both strength and cardiovascular training. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, and holy crap am I feeling it.</p>

<p>Typically, when I start getting more physically active, everything else falls into place: sleeping longer, eating better, making better decisions.</p>

<p><em>Citius</em>, <em>Altius</em>, <em>Fortius</em>.</p>

<h3 id="goal-wealth">Goal: <em>Wealth</em></h3>

<p>My <a href="http://appstore.com/droppedbits?at=11ln59&amp;ct=mbb">iOS apps</a>, despite their neglected state, are about helping people make smarter decisions about their money. My Mac app has the same goal, albeit a bit more involved.</p>

<p>By the way: as they haven&rsquo;t been updated in a while, I&rsquo;ve made the iOS apps free. Give them a try.</p>

<h3 id="goal-self-mastery">Goal: <em>Self-mastery</em></h3>

<p>In a good chunk of my writing, I tend to explore themes related to <em>getting better</em>. Generally, if I&rsquo;m writing about it, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s something that I struggle with, or that I&rsquo;m trying to improve.</p>

<p>Rather than forcing that with weekly posts, I intend on posting longer-form, better-cited articles, at least once a month.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to the next 365 days. I truly hope they&rsquo;re full of love, laughter, and health for you.</p>
