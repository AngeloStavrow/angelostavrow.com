    <section class="content e-content">
        <p>Earlier this week, I had a chance to talk out my approach to learning new things in the context of Cocoa development.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found that I learn best when I get to <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/30939/is-used-in-anger-a-britishism-for-something">use it in anger</a>, but when it comes to something as big and sprawling as the Cocoa framework, there&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of stuff to learn.</p>

<p>Given that I do the vast majority of my development solo, I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to approach this is to break the framework down into manageable chunks, write a little project based around that chunk, and then ship it.</p>

<hr>

<p>I wrote my first app, <a href="http://droppedbits.com/honeyjar">HoneyJar</a>, as a first introduction to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH1-SW1">Objective-C</a> and Xcode. IDEs like Xcode are generally pretty similar&mdash;at their core, they&rsquo;re text editors with some special features&mdash;but Objective-C looked like no other programming language I&rsquo;d ever seen before.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)doYouKnowTheMuffinMan:(TheMuffinMan)theMuffinMan;
</code></pre>

<p><em>(I saw this somewhere on Twitter and I wish I could remember who to credit for it!)</em></p>

<p>I also made the app iPhone-only, as this made for a much less complex platform as far as things like filesystems, window sizes, and interaction go.</p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to explore <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>, adding some libraries to handle some view and viewcontroller tasks&mdash;I had my hands full trying to figure out the language and the platform. I also integrated <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/features/">HockeyApp</a> into the beta version I was working on, to get feedback from friends.</p>

<p>Once I was relatively happy with the app, I revved it to 1.0 and submitted it to the App Store&mdash;again, something I&rsquo;d never done before. HoneyJar was never expected to be some kind of successful product, but a few people have downloaded it, and I know it&rsquo;s been useful to me on occasion.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Apple <a href="https://swift.org/">announced Swift</a>, its new programming language, I got pretty excited. Swift certainly <em>looked</em> a lot more like the programming languages I was familiar with, and there was something really neat about &ldquo;growing up&rdquo; with a new language.</p>

<p>So, I started work on my next app, <a href="http://droppedbits.com/per">Per</a>. Per was all about digging into Swift (which has changed dramatically since the app was written)&mdash;there are no external libraries used anywhere in the app.</p>

<p>I also used it as an opportunity to play with some animations when presenting and dismissing view controllers:</p>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ebc004e4b0aa86f612f6fd/t/54ea85a1e4b08f2aaf399192/1424655859170/unit-conversion.gif?format=500w" alt="Per's unit-converter feature" /></p>

<p>This meant that I got to look into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html">closures</a> as well, again as a small chunk of their applicability.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last week I wrote about <a href="/blog/2016/3/11/on-writing-for-gitlab">writing for GitLab</a> as a means of teaching myself more about their continuous integration features.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now interested in working with <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane tools</a>, so I&rsquo;m working on an app as a counterpart to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues/169">a new article I&rsquo;ll be writing for GitLab</a>. The app is relatively simple: it consumes GitLab&rsquo;s  API to present some kind of a dashboard for project milestones that the user is involved in.</p>

<p>Because I want to focus on learning fastlane, I don&rsquo;t want to worry <em>too</em> much about handling API requests and responses, so I&rsquo;m using a great library called <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">Alamofire</a>, <em>and</em> I&rsquo;m making this a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/">tvOS app</a>.</p>

<p>Why tvOS?</p>

<p>Well, firstly, it&rsquo;s a new platform that I get to play with. That&rsquo;s pretty interesting in and of itself, because while it brings a standardized screen size, it also includes the Siri remote as the sole means of interaction.</p>

<p>But, additionally, an Apple TV assumes a persistent connection to the internet, which means one less thing to worry about: testing for a lack of connectivity (or worse, <em>spotty</em> connectivity).</p>

<p>This way, I can learn about a new platform and a new toolchain without worrying about other pitfalls and perils.</p>

<hr>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how I like to learn: small, neatly defined chunks, where I can focus on the thing I want to find out about, and ship something that showcases what I&rsquo;ve learned. I&rsquo;d love to know what works best for you!</p>
