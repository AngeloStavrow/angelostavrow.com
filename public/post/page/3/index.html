        There&rsquo;s a new kid on the XCTest block, and its name is XCTAssertThrowsError.
I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much on its usage aside from its original discussion on the swift-evolution mailing list and a Stack Overflow question, so here&rsquo;s a little bit of a discussion on how I&rsquo;m using it in a new project of mine.
Swift introduced some pretty neat error handling in 2.0, and Natasha the Robot provided a nice guide on how to throw an error in your code.

        In moving this blog to a static site generator, one concern was whether I&rsquo;d still be able to work on and/or publish a post from my phone. I tend to do a fair bit of mobile drafting while I&rsquo;m in the subway or waiting in line, and will sometimes publish content when I&rsquo;m away from my computer. YOLO.
Requirements It&rsquo;s a given&mdash;since that&rsquo;s how the site has been setup&mdash;that you need a GitLab.

        As I mentioned last week, today is July 1st, which marks a convenient half-way point for the year. On New Year&rsquo;s Day, I posted a short list of goals that I was hoping to make progress towards. Here&rsquo;s how it all breaks down.
1. Post something here every Friday. So far, so good. I haven&rsquo;t missed a single week, which I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with. I&rsquo;ll grant that it hasn&rsquo;t always (ever?

 Next week is July the first. It&rsquo;s Canada Day here, which means it&rsquo;s a national holiday, but in Montreal, it&rsquo;s also an unofficial moving day.
So it&rsquo;s a propos that this site will be moving over to its new digs on that same day.

        This week, I took a hiatus from the refactoring fun I&rsquo;ve undertaken to (finally) move the blog over to a static site generator.
I&rsquo;ve written before about my plans to move to Hugo, and that&rsquo;s now complete. Since the beginning of the year, all posts have been written as Markdown files that I can easily grab and format with the necessary front matter. Before then, I hadn&rsquo;t written very much, and in fact I&rsquo;ve dropped a couple of old posts that I felt didn&rsquo;t add to the site in any way.

        I&rsquo;m in the process of (finally) finalizing the move of this site to Hugo.
No, for real.
Most content is already in place. A few older posts need to be added, and some info pages are to be added. This is normal-priority.
I&rsquo;m using a slightly-modified built-in template to render the site. There a few more modifications to make, but this is low-priority.
A commenting platform will be added. This is also normal-priority.

        The Great HoneyJar Refactoring is a series of posts in which I take the first iOS app I ever wrote, HoneyJar, and refactor it out of its original burning-dumpster-fire state and into a modern app. And I'm doing it in public. Earlier this week, I tweeted about my adventures in trying to add a test suite to HoneyJar.
The idea is this: I want to be sure that I&rsquo;m not breaking anything in the app, as it exists right now, when I start refactoring.

        The Great HoneyJar Refactoring is a series of posts in which I take the first iOS app I ever wrote, HoneyJar, and refactor it out of its original burning-dumpster-fire state and into a modern app. And I'm doing it in public. Last week I introduced an idea I had: to open-source my first-ever iOS app, embarrassing as it might be, and refactor it out in the open.
Over the last week, I handled the open-sourcing of the app.

        Thinking about a series of posts where I take HoneyJar, the first iOS app I wrote, and refactor it out of its burning-dumpster-fire state.
&mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) May 16, 2016 
Over the next few weeks, I&rsquo;ve decided to write a series of posts about taking my first iOS app, HoneyJar, and refactoring it from its current (terrible) state into something, well, less-terrible.
And I plan on doing it in public, too.

        I mentioned that keeping comments up-to-date with modifications in source code helps me with task-switching in a busy workplace.
Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t make a difference if you&rsquo;re not commenting your code well.
Therein lies the rub. I spent weeks on learning various sorting algorithms in my data structures and algorithms class, but I never really learned anything on the whys and wherefores of commenting.
I&rsquo;ve been taught that
// This is an inline comment.
