        I&rsquo;ve discussed the transition over to a static-site generator before.
Yes, I&rsquo;m still planning on doing this.
Yes, it&rsquo;s been a long time coming.
So I&rsquo;m setting a deadline for myself: the next post on this blog will be with the new setup. It probably won&rsquo;t have all the pieces in place re: design and other related-site plans, but I&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere.
More tk.

        As the sole developer at work, I have to balance our “ask me anything, anytime” culture with a need for unbroken concentration on whatever code I&rsquo;m writing.
I&rsquo;m generally fine with a door-always-open policy like this, because it makes communication fast and easy&mdash;especially in a small team, where everyone wears several hats&mdash;but as projects get closer to a deadline, it does tend to put a bit of strain on my ability to get things done.

        This is the 17th post made to this blog since the beginning of 2016.
That means that I&rsquo;ve posted something every Friday since the start of the year.
Yesterday, I suggested that I might not be posting anything today. I&rsquo;ve been feeling a bit tired lately as deadlines loom for work projects, so personal side-projects tend to slip a bit.
But, dammit, the idea of not breaking a streak—especially four months in—really does work as a motivator to keep things going.

        A short post today, based on a realization I had earlier this week at CocoaHeads.
Like many, I often suffer from impostor syndrome. It hits when I&rsquo;m tackling something new that I thought built on previous knowledge, leaving me feeling a bit bewildered, and undermining my confidence in having mastered lesser matters.
Usually, I take a walk and come back to the problem with a clearer head, and will work my way through it.

        On Tuesday of this week, Smile Software announced that their TextExpander software would be switching to a subscription model. As a longtime user and big fan of TextExpander, I have some thoughts on this change.
Another bit of software that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of, YNAB, made a similar switch at the end of 2015&mdash;no more desktop apps sold with traditional licenses, but rather a new web app with a yearly subscription.

        When I hear ship it, or we&rsquo;ll fix it in post&rdquo;, I get that the intended sentiment is that perfect is the enemy of done. But too often, this translates to I&rsquo;m okay with shipping garbage.
There&rsquo;s a delicate balance to be struck between doing it quickly vs. doing it well, sure, but if you&rsquo;re having a hard time getting there, then maybe you&rsquo;ve bitten off more than you can chew.

        Earlier this week, I had a chance to talk out my approach to learning new things in the context of Cocoa development.
I&rsquo;ve always found that I learn best when I get to use it in anger, but when it comes to something as big and sprawling as the Cocoa framework, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to learn.
Given that I do the vast majority of my development solo, I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to approach this is to break the framework down into manageable chunks, write a little project based around that chunk, and then ship it.

        As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I&rsquo;m looking into re-working things a little bit for some of my &ldquo;online presence&rdquo;.
Right now my personal site is just a static landing page. It&rsquo;s generated by Hugo and links to other things (this blog, my Tumblr, GitLab/GitHub, Twitter, &amp;cet.)—and I think it&rsquo;s time to start consolidating some of that.
This blog will be moving to a static-site generator soon, too (again, Hugo). The domain and all links will remain active, but I&rsquo;d like it to also live under a /blog directory on my personal site.

        Yesterday, an article I wrote on setting up GitLab CI for your iOS projects was posted on the GitLab blog.
Now, I&rsquo;m a relative newcomer to continuous integration, but I know that it&rsquo;s valuable. And I also know that GitLab&rsquo;s feature is free, regardless of whether your project is public or private.
I also know that the best way to learn something is to show someone else how to do it—so I launched BBEdit and took notes as I worked my way through the setup, with the intention of posting something here about my experiences.

        While I don&rsquo;t have much to post here this week, I have been writing a technical article over the last couple of weeks. The final draft was submitted yesterday and, barring any unexpected changes or delays, it should be published next week.
It&rsquo;s been an interesting experience, and I intend on discussing it for next week&rsquo;s instalment.
Until then, I&rsquo;m trying to post fun little items and interesting links to Break Before Make more often, so feel free check check that out.
