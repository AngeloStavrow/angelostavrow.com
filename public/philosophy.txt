==============

Should software or a website have a philosophy? Yes, if you want it to matter.

- I believe in accessibility.
- I believe in a network of independently-operated websites.
- I believe in owning your content.
- I believe we can do better than content silos where our creativity is algorithmically analysed and monetized.
- I believe in Publishing on your Own Site and Syndicating Elsewhere. (see: https://indieweb.org/POSSE)
- I believe in RSS.
- I believe in HTML and CSS.
- I believe in JavaScript that serves the reader.

This site is built according to these beliefs.
